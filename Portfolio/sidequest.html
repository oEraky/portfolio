<div>
<br>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Problem</h2>
<br>
<p>
College students have a hard time keeping up with their hobbies in a meaningful way. Attention spans aren't what they used to be, so how do we change that? With just two weeks to work, my team and I had a few points we wanted to research.
<br><br>
• Students don't have time to interact with their hobbies.<br>
• How do students maintain their hobbies consistently?<br>
• How can motivation to keep up with hobbies be cultivated? 
<br><br>

</p>
<p>
Once we had the problems nailed through structured interviews and qualitative coding, we landed on an idea.
<p>
<br>
<b>Why not gamify the process of interacting with your hobbies?</b>
</p>
<br>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Our Objectives</h2>
<br>
<p>
We set out to understand how to implement gamification in an effective way, settling on:
<br><br>
• Reinforcing the behavior of engaging in hobbies.<br>
• Implementing incentives for completing hobby based activities will keep our users accountable.<br>
• Allow for group activities by letting users tackle "quests" together.<br>
</p>
<p>We thought of streaks, reminders and habit scoring, but those felt too similar to already pre-existing applications and competition.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">My Role & Contributions</h2>
<br>
<p>
I conducted a quarter of our semi-structured interviews to gain deeper insights on their hobbies. My findings with my team were:
<br><br>
• Pursuing hobbies can be expensive.<br>
• Technology and social media lead to distraction and low motivation.<br>
• Students find it easier to maintain hobbies<br>
<br>
We floated the idea of an avatar similar to the one in the "Fynch" app. We would develop a similar system where completing "quests" would give you coins you could use to buy items for your avatar.


With our idea solidified, we began prototyping!

</p>

<br>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What We Built</h2>
<br>
<p>
Our low-fi prototype delivered:
<br><br>
• A visual representation of the avatar, with a home, map, friends, and shop screen.<br>
• A main quest that had multiple smaller side quests to complete along the way.<br>
<br>
• A tracker of current hobbies, visualized as "quests"<br><br>

When presenting after the sprint period was over, students reacted well to the prototype.

</p>
<br>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold" >What I Learned</h2>
<br>
<p>
• <b>Ensure a polished protocol.</b> Keeping a strict protocol without leading questions or easy "yes or nos" proved critical due to our time constraints.<br>
• <b>Prioritize.</b> Due to the crunch period, we had to pick and choose how to best approach the project and determine what steps were truly necessary.<br>
• <b>The systems that reduce our attention spans can help us enrich our lives.</b>
