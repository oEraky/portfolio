    Maintaining Hobbies with SideQuest

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Problem</h2>
<div class="backdrop-blur-2xl rounded-xl">
    <p>
      College students have a hard time keeping up with their hobbies in a meaningful way. Attention spans aren't what they used to be, so how do we change that? With just two weeks to work, my team and I had a few points we wanted to research.
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
      <li>Students don't have time to interact with their hobbies.</li>
      <li>How do students maintain their hobbies consistently?</li>
      <li>How can motivation to keep up with hobbies be cultivated?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Once we had the problems nailed through structured interviews and qualitative coding, we landed on an idea.
    </p>

    <p class="font-bold">
      Why not gamify the process of interacting with your hobbies?
    </p>
</div>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Our Objectives</h2>
<div class="backdrop-blur-2xl rounded-xl">

    <p>
      We set out to understand how to implement gamification in an effective way, settling on:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
      <li>Reinforcing the behavior of engaging in hobbies.</li>
      <li>Implementing incentives for completing hobby based activities will keep our users accountable.</li>
      <li>Allow for group activities by letting users tackle "quests" together.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We thought of streaks, reminders and habit scoring, but those felt too similar to already pre-existing applications and competition.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">My Role & Contributions</h2>
<div class="backdrop-blur-2xl rounded-xl">

    <p>
      I conducted a quarter of our semi-structured interviews to gain deeper insights on their hobbies. My findings with my team were:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
      <li>Pursuing hobbies can be expensive.</li>
      <li>Technology and social media lead to distraction and low motivation.</li>
      <li>Students find it easier to maintain hobbies</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We floated the idea of an avatar similar to the one in the "Fynch" app. We would develop a similar system where completing "quests" would give you coins you could use to buy items for your avatar.
    </p>

    <p>
      With our idea solidified, we began prototyping!

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What We Built</h2>
<div class="backdrop-blur-2xl rounded-xl">

    <p>
      Our low-fi prototype delivered:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
      <li>A visual representation of the avatar, with a home, map, friends, and shop screen.</li>
      <li>A main quest that had multiple smaller side quests to complete along the way.</li>
      <li>A tracker of current hobbies, visualized as "quests"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When presenting after the sprint period was over, students reacted well to the prototype.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What I Learned</h2>
    <div class="backdrop-blur-2xl rounded-xl">

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
      <li><b>Ensure a polished protocol.</b> Keeping a strict protocol without leading questions or easy "yes or nos" proved critical due to our time constraints.</li>
      <li><b>Prioritize.</b> Due to the crunch period, we had to pick and choose how to best approach the project and determine what steps were truly necessary.</li>
      <li><b>The systems that reduce our attention spans can help us enrich our lives.</b></li>
