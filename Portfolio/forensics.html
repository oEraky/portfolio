 <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Evaluating Forensics Professors' Needs with the ForensicsXR Teacher's App</h1>
<br>
 <ul>
 <li>Role: UI/UX + Web Developer</li>
<li>Tools: Unity, JavaScript, HTML, CSS</li>
<li>Team: 1 design researcher, 2 developers, 1 forensic expert</li>
</ul>

<br> 
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Problem</h2>
<p>
<br>
• Teachers need a way to evaluate students.<br>
• Teachers need to see the work their students are doing in a way that makes sense. Math is great, but how do we translate data points into real items?<br>
• Teachers need to be able to generate their own crime scenes for students to explore. 
<br><br>
<br>


<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Technical Implementation</h2>
<br>
<p>
I used my technical knowledge of Javascript, HTML and CSS here, connecting my background as a developer with my design oriented mind.
<br><br>
• Use user cards on the homepage to give an easy idea of who each student is, with user IDs for privacy.<br>
• Allow the instructor to see the images their students took, with the date and time the images were taken; that way the professor can see the story their students are telling.<br>
• Create a heatmap that showed the students time spent in each VR point with intensifiying colors, to show consistent movement through the scene!<br>
• Make a function for professors to generate their own crime scenes with simple, drag and drop functionality. All of the functionality, without them needing to worry about too much technical understanding.<br><br>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">User Research</h2>
<p>
  <br>
Aside from developing the systems mentioned above, I also played a significant role in user research and understanding.
    <br><br>
• I led the post experiment survey sessions in a class of 60 students to enhance the VR application.<br>
• I ran one on one interviews with each student who participated to evaluate their needs with the VR application. <br>
• I used qualitative coding to analyze the three major pain points of the VR App: navigation, controller feedback, and visual design.<br>

<br>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Our Outcomes</h2>
<br>
<p>
 The VR application's supporter rate increased by <b>30%</b> after our subsequent experiments.
<br>
• The Teacher's app showed an increase in instructor understanding of student activities.<br>
• I made further developments that halved the time it took to upload student information. Before data entry was manual, so it took about <b>15 minutes to upload data</b>, with the changes I made, that was shortened to <b>just 1 minute.</b><br>
• We were able to secure more funding because of the findings I made!<br>

<br>


<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What I Learned</h2>
<br>
<p>
• <b>Do more research.</b> There were many components I did not understand about the project that I should have researched prior.<br>
• <b>Be timely.</b> To keep up with the intensive workload without burning out, I learned to be more timely.<br>
• <b>Be confident.</b> This project left little room for anxiety, the best work comes when you believe you are good enough to do it.<br>
